    <h1>One Year, One Move, One Love</h1>

    <p >
    
      This year turned out nothing like I planned—<br>
all because of one night that changed everything I thought my future would be.<br>
Loving you has been the easiest thing my heart has ever done,<br>
and somehow, the most challenging too.<br>
      
      It was all easy.<br>
      Emotions ran deep, and some days were heavier than others.<br>
      
      Still, through it all—and with the harder days still ahead—<br>
      isn’t that what this is about?<br>
      P and Chi Chi against the world.<br>

      So today, I made something for us—<br>
      something simple, filled with little moments only we’d remember.<br>
      Something that that will keep us going on those hard days. </p>

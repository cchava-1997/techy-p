    <h1>One Year, One Move, One Love</h1>

    <p >This past year has been one of the most beautiful—and one of the most challenging—I’ve ever known.<br>
      Loving you felt so right, so effortless, like my heart had finally found its home.<br>
      
      But I won’t pretend it was all easy. Emotions ran deep, and some days were heavier than others.<br>
      
      Still, through it all, there’s one thing I’ve never doubted: you and me.<br>
      I know harder days may still come, but isn’t that what we always said? P and Chi Chi against the world.<br>
      
      If this is what you want too, I’m here—completely.<br>
      Ready to fight for us.<br>
      Because a love like this… doesn’t come twice.</p>
